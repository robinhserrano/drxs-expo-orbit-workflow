# Plan technical review

Review a plan that was not created by `/plan`. `/plan` runs this same review inline during
creation, so use this skill for externally-authored plans — hand-written, from another tool,
or from a teammate.

**Plan file:** `$ARGUMENTS` (if empty, ask the user for the plan path or pick the most recent file under `docs/plan/`).

## Review

Follow the [plan review procedure](references/plan-review.md) with `<PLAN_PATH>` set to the
plan file. It runs the simplicity, the project, and scope-splitting agents in parallel, applies their
findings to the plan inline, and resolves any scope-splitting recommendation.

## Handoff

After the review completes, use **AskUserQuestion** to present next steps:

**Question**: "Technical review complete! What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**

1. **Clear context and build (Recommended)**: clear context for a fresh start, then build
2. **Start building**: execute the plan with `/build`
3. **Refine the plan**: improve the plan based on review findings
4. **Done for now**: review complete

**If the user selects "Clear context and build"** → Follow the [clear context handoff](references/clear-context-handoff.md) for `/build` with the actual plan file path. Then stop.

**When invoked by another skill**, return control to the caller after the review completes — do not present handoff options.
